I'm a data scientist based in Denver, CO. This past August I received my PhD in Applied Math from CU Boulder, under my advisor [Vanja Dukic](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/vdukic/).  My thesis work  applied random matrix methods to problems at the intersection of ecology and epidemiology [[1]](/work). I have also worked with the Sensing and Predictive Analytics Group at the National Renewable Energy Lab to apply statistical methods to problems in grid integration of renewable energy [[2,3]](/work).
